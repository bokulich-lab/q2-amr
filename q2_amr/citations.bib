	abstract = {The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; card.mcmaster.ca) combines the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) with curated AMR gene (ARG)  sequences and resistance-conferring mutations to provide an informatics framework  for annotation and interpretation of resistomes. As of version 3.2.4, CARD  encompasses 6627 ontology terms, 5010 reference sequences, 1933 mutations, 3004  publications, and 5057 AMR detection models that can be used by the accompanying  Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software to annotate genomic or metagenomic  sequences. Focused curation enhancements since 2020 include expanded β-lactamase  curation, incorporation of likelihood-based AMR mutations for Mycobacterium  tuberculosis, addition of disinfectants and antiseptics plus their associated  ARGs, and systematic curation of resistance-modifying agents. This expanded  curation includes 180 new AMR gene families, 15 new drug classes, 1 new  resistance mechanism, and two new ontological relationships:  evolutionary\_variant\_of and is\_small\_molecule\_inhibitor. In silico prediction of  resistomes and prevalence statistics of ARGs has been expanded to 377 pathogens,  21,079 chromosomes, 2,662 genomic islands, 41,828 plasmids and 155,606  whole-genome shotgun assemblies, resulting in collation of 322,710 unique ARG  allele sequences. New features include the CARD:Live collection of community  submitted isolate resistome data and the introduction of standardized 15  character CARD Short Names for ARGs to support machine learning efforts.},
