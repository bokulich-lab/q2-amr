This value establishes a threshold for computational prediction of RGI Strict match (above bit-score cut-off) or Loose match (below bit-score cut-off).", "param_type_id": "40725", "param_value": "500"}}, "model_sequences": {"sequence": {"1103": {"protein_sequence": {"accession": "AEX08599.1", "sequence": "MELPNIMHPVAKLSTALAAALMLSGCMPGEIRPTIGQQMETGDQRFGDLVFRQLAPNVWQHTSYLDMPGFGAVASNGLIVRDGGRVLVVDTAWTDDQTAQILNWIKQEINLPVALAVVTHAHQDKMGGMDALHAAGIATYANALSNQLAPQEGMVAAQHSLTFAANGWVEPATAPNFGPLKVFYPGPGHTSDNITVGIDGTDIAFGGCLIKDSKAKSLGNLGDADTEHYAASVRAFGAAFPKASMIVMSHSAPDSRAAITHTARMADKLR"}, "dna_sequence": {"accession": "JN967644.1", "fmin": "0", "fmax": "813", "strand": "+", "sequence": "ATGGAATTGCCCAATATTATGCACCCGGTCGCGAAGCTGAGCACCGCATTAGCCGCTGCATTGATGCTGAGCGGGTGCATGCCCGGTGAAATCCGCCCGACGATTGGCCAGCAAATGGAAACTGGCGACCAACGGTTTGGCGATCTGGTTTTCCGCCAGCTCGCACCGAATGTCTGGCAGCACACTTCCTATCTCGACATGCCGGGTTTCGGGGCAGTCGCTTCCAACGGTTTGATCGTCAGGGATGGCGGCCGCGTGCTGGTGGTCGATACCGCCTGGACCGATGACCAGACCGCCCAGATCCTCAACTGGATCAAGCAGGAGATCAACCTGCCGGTCGCGCTGGCGGTGGTGACTCACGCGCATCAGGACAAGATGGGCGGTATGGACGCGCTGCATGCGGCGGGGATTGCGACTTATGCCAATGCGTTGTCGAACCAGCTTGCCCCGCAAGAGGGGATGGTTGCGGCGCAACACAGCCTGACTTTCGCCGCCAATGGCTGGGTCGAACCAGCAACCGCGCCCAACTTTGGCCCGCTCAAGGTATTTTACCCCGGCCCCGGCCACACCAGTGACAATATCACCGTTGGGATCGACGGCACCGACATCGCTTTTGGTGGCTGCCTGATCAAGGACAGCAAGGCCAAGTCGCTCGGCAATCTCGGTGATGCCGACACTGAGCACTACGCCGCGTCAGTGCGCGCGTTTGGTGCGGCGTTCCCCAAGGCCAGCATGATCGTGATGAGCCATTCCGCCCCCGATAGCCGCGCCGCAATCACTCATACGGCCCGCATGGCCGACAAGCTGCGCTGA", "partial": "0"}, "NCBI_taxonomy": {"NCBI_taxonomy_cvterm_id": "35914", "NCBI_taxonomy_name": "Escherichia coli", "NCBI_taxonomy_id": "562"}}}}, "ARO_accession": "3002356", "ARO_id": "38756", "ARO_name": "NDM-6", "CARD_short_name": "NDM-6", "ARO_description": "NDM-6 is a beta-lactamase found in the Enterobacteriaceae family.", "ARO_category": {"36196": {"category_aro_accession": "3000057", "category_aro_cvterm_id": "36196", "category_aro_name": "NDM beta-lactamase", "category_aro_description": "NDM beta-lactamases or New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases are class B beta-lactamases that confer resistance to a broad range of antibiotics including carbapenems, cephalosporins and penicillins.", "category_aro_class_name": "AMR Gene Family"}, "35939": {"category_aro_accession": "0000020", "category_aro_cvterm_id": "35939", "category_aro_name": "carbapenem", "category_aro_description": "Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, and have a structure which renders them highly resistant to beta-lactamases.
